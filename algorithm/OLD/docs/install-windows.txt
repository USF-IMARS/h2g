H2G INSTALLATION
----------------


Copy the H2G distribution to the desired location
-------------------------------------------------

The "h2g-<version>.zip" file (where <version> is the version number)
contains, at the top-level, a directory named "h2g".  Extract/copy the "h2g"
directory to the desired location (typically a directory named "drl" perhaps
in "C:\Program Files").  All directory paths referred to in these instructions
are relative to the ".\h2g\algorithm" directory.



Rebuilding
----------

If you find it necessary to rebuild the H2G distribution use

  .\build.bat
  
to compile the Java source files and create the "h2g.jar" file in the "lib"
directory.



Execute utility program
-----------------------

The utility program to create a GEOTIFF/JPEG from an HDF has the syntax:

   .\bin\create.sh <iType> <iFile...> <oType> <oFile>
   
   where
   
   <iType> is the type of primary input HDF and must be one of the following:
   atmprofile-tpw, aerosol-aod, aerosol-odr, cloudtop-ctp, cloudtop-irphase,
   cloudmask, sst, chlor, fire, ndvi, lst, 1km (infrared), hkm (true color), or
   qkm (gray scale).
   
   <iFile...> is one or more input HDFs depending on the <iType> as follows:
   
     atmprofile-tpw     <primary>
     aerosol-aod        <primary>
     aerosol-odr        <primary>
     cloudtop-ctp       <primary>
     cloudtop-irphase   <primary>
     cloudmask          <primary> [<geo>]
     sst                <primary> <geo>
     chlor              <primary> <geo>
     fire               <primary> <geo>
     ndvi               <primary> <geo> [<fire>]   (<fire> used for cloud mask)
     lst                <primary> <geo> [<fire>]   (<fire> used for cloud mask)
     1km                <primary> <geo>
     hkm                <primary> <geo>
     qkm                <primary> <geo>
     
   where <primary> is the primary HDF, <geo> is the MxD03 geolocation HDF,
   and <fire> is the fire detection primary HDF.  Square brackets indicate an
   optional input HDF.
   
   <oType> is the type of GEOTIFF/JPEG to create and must be one of the
   following:
   
     geotiff.argb       (GEOTIFF with alpha and RGB components)
     geotiff.u8cm       (GEOTIFF with an 8-bit color map)
     jpeg.argb          (JPEG with alpha and RGB components)

   <oFile> is the output file.
